    "description": "Alternating Bicep Curls are a classic arm workout that targets the biceps brachii, helping to build size and strength.\n\nHow to Perform:\n- Stand upright, holding a dumbbell in each hand with your palms facing forward.\n- Curl one dumbbell up toward your shoulder, keeping your elbow close to your torso.\n- Squeeze your biceps at the top, then slowly lower the dumbbell back down.\n- Repeat with the other arm, alternating between left and right.\n\nMuscles Worked:\n✔ Biceps brachii (main target)\n✔ Brachialis (helps add arm thickness)\n✔ Forearms (secondary engagement)\n\nThis exercise helps build stronger, more defined arms while improving muscle symmetry and control. 💪",

                "✔ Maintain Proper Posture – Stand upright with your chest up, shoulders back, and core engaged.",
                "✔ Keep Your Elbows Stationary – Your elbows should stay close to your torso without moving forward.",
                "✔ Use a Full Range of Motion – Curl the weight all the way up and fully extend your arm at the bottom.",
                "✔ Lift and Lower Slowly – Control both the lifting (concentric) and lowering (eccentric) phases to maximize tension.",
                "✔ Squeeze at the Top – Hold the contraction for a second at the peak of the movement.",
                "✔ Use a Challenging but Manageable Weight – Choose a weight that allows controlled movement without cheating.",
                "✔ Breathe Correctly – Exhale as you lift the dumbbell and inhale as you lower it."
